 # **Simulation of a Two-Zone Model of a Combustion Engine**

---
A two-zone model is simulated with MATLAB, and you can find Volume, Area, Velocity, Burn Fraction, Unburned/Burned Area/Mass/Temperature/Volume, Pressure, and Work here.

In Sec.1 some initial values such as Compression Ratio, density, etc are configured.

In Sec.2 Volume and Area are calculated.
